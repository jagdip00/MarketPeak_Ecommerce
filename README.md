# Steps for Deploying the Entire Flow

I started off by creating a directory in my Linux EC2 instance and initialised it as a Git repository. Then I downloaded a eCommerce website template from the "themewagon.com" website to the Linux EC2 instance. I then staged the website directory to the Git repository and set the Git global configuration to my GitHub username and email and commited the initial basic website.
