# Steps for Deploying the Entire Flow

I started off by creating a directory in my Linux EC2 instance and initialised it as a Git repository. Then I downloaded a eCommerce website template from the "themewagon.com" website to the Linux EC2 instance. I then staged the website directory to the Git repository and set the Git global configuration to my GitHub username and email and commited the initial basic website.

I then had to create a repository on GitHub with the name "MarketPeak_Ecommerce" and link the my local repositroy from Linux EC2 with my GitHub and push the commit to the from local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.
